# 42 School Piscine

This repository contains exercises, projects, and rushes completed during my participation in the 42 school piscine.

## Description

The **42 school piscine** is an intensive 4-week learning period where students are immersed in the world of programming using the C language. Each day, new concepts are introduced, and practical exercises are assigned to put these freshly acquired knowledge into practice.

One notable aspect of the piscine is the weekly exams held every Friday, testing the students' understanding of the material covered throughout the week.
